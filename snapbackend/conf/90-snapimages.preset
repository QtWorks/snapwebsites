# systemd file defining the few services we want to have start as disabled
#
# To change these values, create a file with th same name under:
#
#    /etc/systemd/system-preset/90-snapbackend.preset
#
# However, remember that you must replace the entire file. There are other
# ways to override the values, but this is the most legal as an administrator.
#
# If a different package wants to overwrite the defaults, then it has to
# create a file with a lower priority (i.e. "85-snapimages.preset") and
# place it under /lib/systemd/system-preset
#
