  * SNAP-648 -- Remove the backends=... from snapserver.conf on a purge of
    snapbackend.
  * Transformed the snapwatchdog server message dispatcher from a set of
    if() statements to a snap dispatcher used on itself and the messenger.
  * Removed a few logs that I used for debug purposes and inadvertendly
    checked in.
  * Removed the `systemctl stop <snapbackend service>` from the postrm:
    (1) it's automatically done in the prerm and (2) it would be too late,
    it has to be done in prerm.
  * Changed the try_dispatching_message() in a dispatch_message() since we
    can call process_message() from within it and save on many dual calls.
  * Handle the default snap communicator messages within the snap_communicator
    library object (HELP, LOG, QUITTING, READY, STOP, UNKNOWN)
  * Created a get_commands() to have an automatic "HELP" implementation.

snapwebsites (1.5.103.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Finally found the problem with the permissions, for virtual pages, we

snapwebsites (1.5.102.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Actually the journal_list objects must be allocated because we can't have
    a pointer to that object from a vector without the huge risk of having
    that pointer invalidated at some point. It also fixes the done() and
    destructor problems and I successfully create a company!

snapwebsites (1.5.101.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Removed the test in the journal_list() destructor, it can't work because
    the vector implies copies which means done() isn't called.

snapwebsites (1.5.99.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Made code -Weffc++ compatible.
  * In case of Qt dialogs/windows, I moved the #include "ui_*.h" file within
    the #pragma diagnostic so the derived class doesn't get us an error.
  * Removed the cell post ++ and -- because it returns itself and effective
    C++ says we should not have such. We're not using that feature anyway.
  * Added a copy and assignement operators to classes with a bare pointer.
  * Converted a struct + function in a lambda now that we have C++11.
  * Check for /var/mail/root emails, if present show a warning in the
    "test_mta" field (snapwatchdog plugin of snapmanager.cgi).

  * Added a screenshot of the snapmanager interface for the docs.
  * Updated various documentations.

  * Moved the snapwatchdog-data.xsl source file to the manager plugin.
  * Made the watchdog data file output shown in the snapmanager.cgi screens.
  * Added a menu entry to reach that page.
  * Tweaked the snapmanagercgi.cpp so it can have plugins generate the page
    output and add menu items.
  * Actually fixed the select="menu/select", it was supposed to be named:
    select="menu/status" instead and we really only expect one.
  * Made the images use "/..." instead of no slash.
  * Fixed the tests order in manager_cgi::verify() so they happen.
  * Made snapmanager.cgi symbols available to `dl`.

  * Fixed the JS to remove old feedback messages, the while() was not working.
  * Fixed the tabs in the snapmanager, they look decent now and match their
    surrounding which makes it easier to see which is selected.
  * Made small adjustments to the code to get the correct classes to help with
    the CSS of the tabs and the tab panels.
  * Added a snapmanager.cgi widget (a link really) to view watchdog results
    (although the link destination doesn't work yet...)
  * Changed the snapwatchdog XML to include a valid header.

  * Added a mark on the backend services so snapwatchdog knows they are
    backends and it can manage them slightly differently.
  * Cleaned up the get_retry_from_content() of the snapmanagercgi and
    especially properly test a couple more potential errors.
  * Enhanced the processes check to avoid generating errors when the system
    backends were clearly disabled.

  * Changed the use of the status_file with two variables in the snapserver.conf
    file instead (backend_status and backends).
  * Removed the backend service dropdown functionality, instead you have to use
    the "backends" parameter. If present there, then the backend is expected
    to be active whenever the all_services is ON.
  * Properly implemented the Restore Default button of backend and watchdog.
  * Removed a couple of TODO that are actually done now.
  * Removed BACKENDALLSERVICES and force people to do a "Save Everywhere".

    file exists, if not avoid accessing it (it throws otherwise.)
  * Allow for the mandatory flag to work in duplicated process definitions
    in the snapwatchdog XML files.
  * Try creating the folders if message for the snapmanager.cgi session.
    (Reality is that it's unlikely to work because Apache won't have
    permissions butat least I have better error messages.)
  * When trying to create a new session, do 10 attempts max. and fail.
  * Removed the default from/admin. emails from snapwatchdog.
  * Changed the WARNING in a HIGHLIGHT when snapwatchdog is disabled.
  * Added snapmanager.cgi fields to manage snapwatchdog emails and plugins.

    is installed (since sending an email wouldn't do any good...)
  * Various clean ups.

snapwebsites (1.5.86.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Added a daily cron along snapmta so we attempt to dequeue emails once a
    day (becausewe may send emails only very rarely so it could otherwise
    get stuck there for a very long time.)

    a tool named /usr/sbin/sendmail.
  * Added ntpd as a process that needs to be running.
  * Fixed the path to the *-processes.xml files in the .install files.
  * Removed the dependency on snapwatchdog from snapserver (it was a test.)

  * Made snapwatchdog capable of running its plugins and RUSAGE even without
    the Cassandra cluster (otherwise it would not be capable of cleanly
    reporting that Cassandra is down)
  * Added code to report errors found by the snapwatchdog plugins by sending
    an email to the site administrator_email user or email list.
  * Added a log rotate for the RUSAGE files since we use the PID for the name.

    XSTL 2.0 script.
  * Added support for marking processes as mandatory for the system.
  * Changed the list of processes from  the snapwatchdog.conf file to a list
    of XML files, just drop extra XML files and more processes get checked.
  * Replaced the watchdog_processes with watchdog_processes_path.
  * Added XML files to check for processes (snaplog, snapserver, snaplistd,
    and snapwatchdog for the expected defaults)
  * Installed those XML files with process definitions.
  * Added validation of the process XML files to the CMakeLists.txt.
  * Protected all the std::cout in snapbackup with a --verbose.
  * Force ownership of snapbackup.log to snapwebsites:snapwebsites.

    to work with the new snapwatchdog.
  * In the confirmation of the drop command, it's not usable in a batch but
    now it won't just sit there.
  * Added a couple of exception and use those instead of std::...() ones.
  * Added the quoted_printable_encode_and_set_data() function to the email
    class so we don't have to duplicate that code over and over.
  * Added a mkdir_p() that take an std::string or char const *.

  * Finished up the snapwatchdog plugin that runs shell script to test the
    health of the system.
  * Added support so we can capture stderr output from processes we start
    with our snap::process class.
  * Support two callbacks one for stdout and one for stderr.
  * Added a test in get_arg() so we throw if you never called get_args_size().
  * Fixed a bug in the fork() implementation, we had to use dup2() and not
    close() + dup() because race conditions can always happen.
  * Actually implemented the find_process tool used in the
    watch_firewall_fail2ban_client script.
  * Added a starter script so snapwatchdog scripts get kick started now
    giving us the /etc/default/snapwatchdog script for user settings.
  * Fixed the snapwatchdog server, we would add child process to the
    list of processes even if the fork() failed.
  * Applied a fix to the statvfs() call which can block if a device is
    over the network and is failing. It uses an alarm now.
  * Added a more detailed header so we know which computer is failing.

  * Fixed closing the console, it now calls endwin() in the right place.
  * Fixed some old comments in snap_communicator so they match current status.
  * Moved the restore_fd() calls to the close_ncurse() because it has to be
    done at the right location (i.e. after the delscreen().)
  * Applied a fix to the console so the pointer appears at the correct
    location after output() was called.
  * Use a weak pointer in one location that would lock up the snap_console.

    a writer or a reader.

    the fd and sends them through the process_line() callback.
  * Enhanced the console implementation to redirect the stdout and stderr
    to the output area instead of anywhere on the screen.
  * Added a process_help() callback so when F1 is pressed, it gets called.

  * Moved the snapcommunicator dispatcher in its own file so it can use the

  * process_message() is now defined in a separate class so we can have a
    default that throws if called. Useful if your dispatcher has a last entry
    which is a catch-all.
  * Added an always_match() function for the dispatcher catch-all entry.
  * Added a "reply with UNKNOWN" function.
  * Made all the send_message() functions return true or false.

  * Fixed bug in libdbproxy, a contexts() call was not changed to getContexts()
  * Fixed the bug with consistency levels: the disconnect() resets it back to

    QUORUM is currently forced because I missed that bug before! It is also
    safer with QUORUM always...

snapwebsites (1.5.22.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-591: Existing links may need to be deleted before we create new ones.

snapwebsites (1.5.16.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * The fix to the root user permissions actually exposed another bug: the
    updating of the cache could end up using an empty version of the list
    of permissions when we shortcut the calculation of the permissions to
    know whether the user is allowed (i.e. the default list is the empty
    list and we would save that even if we did not call the function used
    to generate the list of permissions of a page.)

snapwebsites (1.5.9.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * EX-79: Found out that if a page supports more than one image, then we must
    have a field name and not use "image" as that name. We may have a problem
    with the body which does not offer a separate field name for each image...

    directory.
  * Updated some manager-plugins to use the new `widget_select` for drop
    downs.

  * SNAP-222: Checking whether a file was properly added required to test
    with the correct path and not whether a file is attached to the field

    to use using AJAX.)

snapwebsites (1.5.2.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * SNAP-579: Split snaplistd/snaplog into a new bundle: mysql. These bundles
    both rely on the mysql bundle to be installed. And both bundles will
    manage their respective users and tables, removing them when purged.
