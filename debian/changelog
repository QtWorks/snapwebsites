snapwebsites (1.5.54.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

snapwebsites (1.5.47.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fix the snap_config so it uses exceptions instead of exit(1). That way
    we avoid problems with mutexes (i.e. they properly get unlocked.)

snapwebsites (1.5.45.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Finished up the snapwatchdog plugin that runs shell script to test the
    health of the system.
  * Added support so we can capture stderr output from processes we start
    with our snap::process class.
  * Support two callbacks one for stdout and one for stderr.
  * Added a test in get_arg() so we throw if you never called get_args_size().
  * Fixed a bug in the fork() implementation, we had to use dup2() and not
    close() + dup() because race conditions can always happen.
  * Actually implemented the find_process tool used in the
    watch_firewall_fail2ban_client script.
  * Added a starter script so snapwatchdog scripts get kick started now
    giving us the /etc/default/snapwatchdog script for user settings.
  * Fixed the snapwatchdog server, we would add child process to the
    list of processes even if the fork() failed.
  * Applied a fix to the statvfs() call which can block if a device is
    over the network and is failing. It uses an alarm now.
  * Added a more detailed header so we know which computer is failing.
  * Various cleanups.

  * Added the log_subfolder, from_email, administrator_email variables.
  * Fixed the loop calling our scripts (the folders were still mixed up.)
  * Use sh to start our scripts since they won't be "755".
  * Fixed a bug in defining the `scripts_path`, the wrong variable was used.
  * Made sending the email dependent on the from/to emails availability.

  * Added a flag to decide whether to output the brand info.

  * Fixed URL to snapwebsites, it uses https now.

snapwebsites (1.5.39.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Enhanced the console in various ways.
  * Fixed closing the console, it now calls endwin() in the right place.
  * Fixed some old comments in snap_communicator so they match current status.
  * Moved the restore_fd() calls to the close_ncurse() because it has to be
    done at the right location (i.e. after the delscreen().)
  * Applied a fix to the console so the pointer appears at the correct
    location after output() was called.
  * Use a weak pointer in one location that would lock up the snap_console.

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:25:10 -0700

snapwebsites (1.5.38.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Enhanced some error messages for invalid calls to get_parameters() so
    we know which command and parameter generated the error.
  * Added a close() function on the snap_fd_connection.
  * Added a mark_close() function so we can let snap_fd_connection know.
  * Also check get_socket() in is_writer()/is_reader() if closed that's not
    a writer or a reader.
  * Added a set of read/write function to the snap_fd_connection.
  * Added the Snap FD Buffer Connection which reads lines of data coming in
    the fd and sends them through the process_line() callback.
  * Enhanced the console implementation to redirect the stdout and stderr
    to the output area instead of anywhere on the screen.
  * Added a process_help() callback so when F1 is pressed, it gets called.
  * Added an implementation of process_quit() to restore the FD as required
    (i.e. stdout and stderr).
  * Started on a message dialog to help create messages.

snapwebsites (1.5.37.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Added libncurse and libreadline as Source dependencies.
  * Moved the snapcommunicator dispatcher in its own file so it can use the
    logger (they currently inter include each others...)
  * process_message() is now defined in a separate class so we can have a
    default that throws if called. Useful if your dispatcher has a last entry
    which is a catch-all.
  * Added an always_match() function for the dispatcher catch-all entry.
  * Added a "reply with UNKNOWN" function.
  * Made all the send_message() functions return true or false.
  * Added logging in the snapmessage tool since we don't always get all the
    messages on screen (especially on a crash/quit situation.)
  * Various clean ups.

snapwebsites (1.5.33.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Added the snapmessage command line tool to test messaging between
    services from the command line (could use scripts, probably).
  * Allow for add_connection() to be called with a null pointer.

  * Added the dispatcher template and sub-class.
  * Removed the process_message() from the 
    `snap_tcp_blocking_client_message_connection` class, it's not required
    since we have on in the `snap_tcp_client_message_connection`

  * Use the pointer_t for advgetopt in snapdb.h instead of redefining it.
  * Added a parameter to the form error log for easier debugging.
  * Removed the WARNING of the server manager about typing the wrong name
    since Doug added a drop down and thus you can't make such a mistake.
  * Fixed a few #include for advgetopt which should always have used the path.

snapwebsites (1.5.29.1~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fixed the e-store settings, only the store_name field would get saved.
  * In the Stripe implementation, if store_name is not defined, cleanly
    generate an error (we may want to do that much earlier, though.)

 -- Alexis Wilke <alexis@m2osw.com>  Thu, 07 Dec 2017 01:43:17 -0700

snapwebsites (1.5.28.1~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Fixed bug in libdbproxy, a contexts() call was not changed to getContexts()
  * Fixed the bug with consistency levels: the disconnect() resets it back to
    ONE and so if we want to use QUORUM it has to be set after. Note that
    QUORUM is currently forced because I missed that bug before! It is also
    safer with QUORUM always...
  * Applied various clean ups to the libdbproxy.
  * Updated the INSTALL file, although it should really be fixed 100%...
  * Fixed my start script since snapmanagerdaemon is now in .../snapmanager/.

    search engines from indexing such sites by telling them NOINDEX.
  * Fixed reference to snapwebsites.org with HTTPS.
  * Fixed the tag name: X-Robots-Tag -- we were missing "-Tag".

snapwebsites (1.5.21.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

snapwebsites (1.5.16.0~xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * The fix to the root user permissions actually exposed another bug: the
    updating of the cache could end up using an empty version of the list
    of permissions when we shortcut the calculation of the permissions to
    know whether the user is allowed (i.e. the default list is the empty
    list and we would save that even if we did not call the function used
    to generate the list of permissions of a page.)
