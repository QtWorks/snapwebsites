#
# Description:
#      Library used by the Snap! Websites front ends which make use of Qt,
#      X-Windows and other equivalents (i.e. you are likely to need a
#      Desktop.) Because of that, it can't be merged with the basic
#      libsnapwebsites.
#
# Documentation:
#      See the CMake documentation.
