* Compile, Build, Install

This project uses cmake to generate the Makefile necessary to build the
project.

Here are the original installation info. We suggest you look for the packages
from our PPA instead. Also check the bin/build-snap script for a way to build
everything. You want to run bin/snap-ubuntu-packages once to make sure your
developer box has all the necessary packages installed.

   tar xf snapwebsites-0.1.0.tar.gz
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where_you_want_it_to_go> ../snapwebsites-0.1.0
   make
   [sudo] make install

This should work on all Unices. We have not yet worked on the project to
get it to function under MS-Windows.
