* Compile, Build, Install

This project requires many other contribs and a main snapcpp project
which is in charge of compiling everything.

Make sure to look at the snapcpp project and look at this script:

    bin/build-snap

That's probably the easiest way for you to get started on the development
of the Snap! Websites. On Ubuntu, you can also run:

    snap-ubuntu-packages --optional

to first make sure that all the development dependencies are install.
The --optional command line option is used to install a few extras which
are not required by can be useful (i.e. documentation and test related.)

The main project has a long README.md file with much more information
about how to get started on the project.
